# Development-of-Autonomous-Crazyflie-Swarm-and-Physicomimetic-Emergence-in-Swarm-Topologies
This project explores the potential implementation of physicomimetic emergent algorithms in a Crazyflie swarm. Additionally, it explores the aspects of development involved in utilising the Crazyflie drones for said swarm, including developing appropriate modifications to the Crazyflie API, firmware and GUI for the Crazyflie client. This project also makes use of an emergent swarm simulation developed in the Unity Engine to serve as a digital twin to its physical Crazyflie counterpart. These simulated drones are regulated by a PID controller that has been iteratively fine-tuned to maintain their flight as well as the structure of the swarm. Different topologies that vary in their decision-making process are developed to discover an optimal solution for implementing emergent behaviour in a Crazyflie swarm. This project finds that, contrary to previous assumptions, topologies that implement the least interaction complexity perform better than topologies that consider more information and implement more complex decision-making methods. These conclusions are visualised and represented with empirical data showing different types of interactions within the swarm.
